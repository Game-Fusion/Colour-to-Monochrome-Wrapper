|CCSand|Thanks to Gonow32's superb work on Wrapper v1.3, this game now boots - and if this game and all other tested games boot, we have 100% compatibility. We still require controls for selecting entities and placing them onscreen, pausing, exiting etc., but booting is a good start|

# To be patched:

|Game Name|Notes|
|:-------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|Helios|Major patch required, critical graphical glitch means the game boots however there is nothing on-screen|
|Redirection|Colossal amount of patching required, critical graphical glitches in levels and lack of mouse clicks and drags will make this extremely hard if not impossible to patch|
|Battle|Minor patch required, mouse clicking is missing however you could change the buttons to keys without too much effort|
|Breakout|Semi-major patch required, some severe graphical glitches but game is otherwise playable|
|Building Game|Major patch required, game is heavily mouse reliant - game will likely not be released due to how hard a patch would be|
|Fish Simulator|Minor patch required, background is completely missing and the fish are hardly visible|
