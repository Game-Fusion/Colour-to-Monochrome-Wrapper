|Skyfall|*****|Game runs at full speed with no critical issues. Minor graphical glitch with the Nitrosoft Title display|
|Redirection (with patch)|***|Game boots fine once click is changed to enter, you can't proceed due to lack of mouse_drag and graphical glitches|
|Redirection|**|Game boots but you are stuck at the "Click to begin" screen|
|Game of Life|**|[Lewisk3's Game of Life] Boots with no issues, gets in-game, however you can't proceed due to no mouse click and the API involved|
